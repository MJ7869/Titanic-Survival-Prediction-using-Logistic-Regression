# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression

**Overview**

This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using the famous Titanic dataset. The goal is to apply Logistic Regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm, to determine the likelihood of a passenger surviving the disaster based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, and more.

**Project Structure**

- **Data:** The dataset used is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which contains information on 891 passengers including whether they survived or not.

- **Model:** Logistic Regression is used as the primary model for binary classification.

- **Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score.

**Technologies Used**

- **Python:** Programming language.

- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.

- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.

- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For data visualization.

- **Scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating the Logistic Regression model.

- **Google Colab Notebook:** For interactive development and exploration.

**Results**

The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 84% on the test set. The results indicate that certain features like passenger class, age, and gender have a significant impact on survival probability.
